## 🔥 Core Features

### 🔘 YANA Circles
Create or join **Circles**—private or public groups based on interests, departments, buildings, or hobbies. Whether you're forming a study group, a cultural club, or a tech squad, **Circles** allow you to build micro-communities with their own posts, discussions, and events.

> _"Circles within the Circle—because everyone belongs somewhere."_

---

### 📚 YANA Shelf
A digital sharing space for your locality. Borrow, lend, donate, or trade books, electronics, tools, or anything else. Think of it as your **hyperlocal OLX or community library**, built on trust and sharing.

> _"One person's extra is another’s essential. Share smarter."_

---

### 📢 YANA Bulletin
Your community’s **public announcement board**. From lost items and upcoming events to water shutdowns or emergency alerts, the **Bulletin** keeps everyone in the loop—fast.

> _"If it affects all, it belongs on the bulletin."_
